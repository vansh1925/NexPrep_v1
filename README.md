NexPrep
NexPrep v1 â€“ First Launch ðŸš€

NexPrep started as a mock interview platform built to help students practice coding and behavioral interviews in a structured way.

Core Features (v1)

User login & authentication

Coding interview practice with real-time code execution

Behavioral interview Q&A practice (static question bank)

Result tracking with simple scoring

Tech Stack (v1)

Frontend: React + Tailwind

Backend: Node.js (Express)

Database: MongoDB

Hosting: Vercel + Render

ðŸŽ¯ Goal of v1: Validate the idea quickly by giving users a place to practice interviews online. It was all about building fast, shipping early, and learning from real usage.

NexPrep v2 â€“ The Next Step âœ¨

After building v1, I realized mock interviews arenâ€™t just about practice â€” theyâ€™re about personalized feedback, real-time interactivity, and making prep feel closer to the real thing.

Whatâ€™s New in v2

AI-powered interviewer (for both coding & behavioral)

Voice-enabled interviews (simulate actual interview flow)

Rich analytics dashboard with progress tracking

Improved authentication with OAuth (Google/GitHub login)

Scalable backend with FastAPI + LangChain integration

Cleaner UI/UX and faster performance

ðŸŽ¯ Goal of v2: Move from a simple practice tool â†’ to an AI-powered mock interview platform that feels like sitting across from a real interviewer.
